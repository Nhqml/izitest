Introduction
============

``izitest`` provides an easy way to test executable against a test suite.

**Disclaimer**: this package and everything contained in the `repo`_ is still a **WIP**.
Some features can be unstable or even not implemented! Use at your own risk...

Motivation
**********

I often need to test personal as well as school project but I don't want to waste my time doing a new test suite for each new project.

Therefore I decided to write a test suite that could be used for every project I do, the only thing that need to change are the tests (written in YAML).

Limitations
***********

For me, this is the perfect test suite... Not for you? Fell free to `contribute`_ or open an `issue`_ to make it better!

Installation
************

You can use pip to install ``izitest``! Simply run ``pip install izitest``.
